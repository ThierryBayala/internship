For example, if you had tags for a million stackoverflow questions and answers, you could find tags that are related to a given tag and recommend the related ones for exploration. You can do this by treating each set of co-occuring tags as a \"sentence\" and train a Word2Vec model on this data. Granted, you still need a large number of examples to make it work. \n"
